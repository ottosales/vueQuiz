# Video Game Quiz
A basic quiz site using Vue.js to practice what I've studied in the last couple days. It was done through the tutorial available at https://youtu.be/4deVCNJq3qc.

It always consists of 10 questions randomly fetch'd by the opentdb (Open Trivia Database) API, and they always have the video game theme. 

Below are the vue project generated instructions to guide you on how to use the app.
